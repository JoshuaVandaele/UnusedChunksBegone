# Unused Chunks, Begone

## Use case

This script is a script that locates and deletes unloaded and unused chunks inside of region files. This saves significants amounts of space. (In my own testing, it went down by five or seven folds.)

## Usage

Put all of your .mca region files into the `input` folder and then run the script. Once it finished, you can replace your old region files with the one inside of the `output` folder.

## Arguments

- `--nokeep` Delete the files as they are done being treated (Default: False)
- `--input "directory"` Select your input folder (Default: ./input/)
- `--output "directory"` Select your output folder (Default: ./output/)
- `--optimisechunks` Will also attempt to optimise individual chunks by deleting cached data, at the cost of performance upon reloading the chunks. The storage gain is MINOR only use this if you absolutely need it. (Default: False)
- `--replace` Replaces the files in your input directory with the optimised ones. Overrides `--nokeep` and `--output`
